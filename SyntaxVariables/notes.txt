Topics:-

Variables:- Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. 
Basically it is a container for storing data of different different data types.

x = 10   # integer
y = 3.14 # float
name = "Ankit" # string
is_python_easy = True # boolean


Naming Convention for Variables:-
i) only contains letters, digits and underscore(_)
ii) Can't start with a digit
iii) case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different)
iv) avoid using python keywords (if, else, for)

Valid Examples
age = 21
_city = "Mumbai"
total_score = 95


Invalid Example:-
 1name = "Error"
function = 10
user-city = "Mumbai"



Data Types:- It simply means the kind of value a variable holds.

Every Vaiables in Python stores some sort of data, and that can be of a certain type - like integer, floats, strings, Boolean.

By default in Python these are the builtin data types:-

Numeric Data:-
Integer:- whole numbers, positive and negative. (5, -10)
float = Floating-pointy numbers(numbers with decimal point)(3.14, -0.5)
Complex = 6 + 2i

Sequence Types
String:- Sequence of characters like "Hello Python".
list:- Ordered, mutable collection of items, enclosed in square brackets.
tuple:- Ordered immutable collection of items, enclosed in square bracket.
range:- Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, often used in loops. e.g., 

Set Types:-
set:- Unordered collection of unique items, enclosed in curly braces, e.g., {1,2,3}
frozenset:- Immutable version of a set.


Mapping Type:-
dict:- Dictionaries {"name":"Rayan"}


Boolean :-  True or False

Note:- In Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type




Getting the type of Variable :-
In python we basically use type() function to check the type ofg particular variable


You can even delete a variable using del keyword

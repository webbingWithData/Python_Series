What is a Function
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task whenever it is called.
In large programs, instead of writing the same code multiple times, we put it inside a function and reuse it whenever needed. This keeps our program neat and organized.

Types of Functions in Python
There are mainly two types of functions in Python

Built-in Functions – These are already available in Python, ready to use.
Examples len(), sum(), max(), print(), list(), etc.

User-defined Functions – These are functions we create ourselves to perform specific tasks.

How to Define a Function
In Python, we use the def keyword to define a function.

Here’s the syntax

def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    # statements


The function name follows the same rules as variable names.

Parentheses () can include parameters if needed.

A colon  must be used at the end of the function definition.

The code inside the function must be indented.

Example (Fresh & Relatable)
Let’s take a simple example where we want to calculate the square of a number.

def square(num)
    result = num  num
    print(The square of, num, is, result)

# calling the function
square(5)
square(12)

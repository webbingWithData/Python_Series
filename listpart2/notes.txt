Iteration over Lists:-

let's discus iteration first:-
In a very simple word it is the process of accessing elements from the list one by one

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango","guava", "grapes", "jackfruit"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

here for loop will print the element of fruits list one by one

now, if you want elements with indexes of the list then we can use enumerate() function for that:-

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)


Nested List:-
A nested list is a list within another list, which is useful for representing matrices or tables. We can access nested elements by chaining indexes.


matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]


for accessing elements of the matrix by index:-
print(matrix[1][1])

and if You want to print each elements of your matrix in one go then you have to run nested loops

for row in matrix:
    for num in row:
        print(num, end=" ")


list comprehension:-
a concise way to create lists using a single line of code. It is useful for applying an operation or filter to items in an iterable, such as a list or range.

simple for loop
square = []
for i in range(1,6):
    square.append(i**2)

using list comprehension;-
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(square)

you can even add a conditon in it as well:- 

evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)

you can even use it in matrix as well
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print(flattened)

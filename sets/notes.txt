1. What is a Set in Python?

In Python, a set is a collection that is unordered, unindexed, and does not allow duplicates.
Think of it like a basket of fruits  â€” you donâ€™t care about the order, you just want unique items inside the basket.

Code Example:

fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "apple"}
print(fruits)


2. Creating a Set

"We can create sets using curly braces {} or the set() constructor."

Code Example:

my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

another_set = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])
print(another_set)

3. Accessing Items

Unlike lists or tuples, sets are unordered, so you canâ€™t use indexes. But you can loop through them.

Code Example:

for item in {"pen", "book", "pencil"}:
    print(item)

4. Adding & Updating Items

We use .add() for single items and .update() for multiple.

Code Example:

my_set = {1, 2}
my_set.add(3)
my_set.update([4, 5])
print(my_set)

5. Removing Items

.remove(item) â†’ gives error if item not found

.discard(item) â†’ safe removal

.pop() â†’ removes random item

Code Example:

my_set = {10, 20, 30}
my_set.remove(20)
my_set.discard(40)  
print(my_set)

6. Set Operations (Real Power ðŸ’ª)

Hereâ€™s where sets shine â€” think of them like math sets.

Union (combine)

a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {3, 4, 5}
print(a | b)   # or a.union(b)


Intersection (common elements)

print(a & b)   # or a.intersection(b)


Difference (whatâ€™s in A but not B)

print(a - b)


Symmetric Difference (in either, but not both)

print(a ^ b)


Real world example:
Suppose you have two groups of students: one playing cricket, one playing football. With sets, you can easily find who plays both, who plays only cricket, and so on!

7. Other Set Methods

len() â†’ number of items

clear() â†’ remove all

copy() â†’ make a duplicate

issubset(), issuperset(), isdisjoint()

Example:

a = {1, 2}
b = {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(a.issubset(b))   # True
print(b.issuperset(a)) # True

8. Frozen Sets

Thereâ€™s also something called frozenset, which is an immutable version of set. Once created, you canâ€™t change it.

Example:

fset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
# fset.add(4) â†’ This will give an error
